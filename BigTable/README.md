Cloud Bigtable is Google's NoSQL Big data database service.
Bigtable is designed to handle massive workloads at consistent low latency and high throughput.
great choice:
- for both operational and analytical applications
- if they're working with more than one terabyte of semi-structured or structured data
- Data is fast with high throughput, or it's rapidly changing
- NoSQL
- Data is a time-series or has natural semantic ordering.
- Big data running asynchronous batch or synchronous real-time processing on the data running machine learning algorithms on the data.
- Bigtable is best for analytical data with heavy read and write events, like AdTech, financial, or IoT data.
- wide-column database
- ‘fast lookup’ non-relational database for datasets too large to store in memory
