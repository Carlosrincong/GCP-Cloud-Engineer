# DATAFLOW

Cloud Dataflow is a managed service for executing a wide variety of **data processing** patterns in **data pipelines**.
It's essentially a fully managed service for **transforming and enriching data** in **stream and batch** modes with equal reliability and expressiveness.
It is based on **Apache Beam**, which provides a rich set of windowing and session analysis primitives, as well as an ecosystem of source and sync connectors.
