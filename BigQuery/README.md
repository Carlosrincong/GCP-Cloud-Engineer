# BIGQUERY 

BigQuery is recommended as a data warehouse, is the default storage for tabular data, and is optimized for large-scale, ad-hoc SQL-based analysis and reporting.
While BigQuery data manipulation language (DML) enables you to update, insert, and delete data from your BigQuery tables, because it has a built-in cache BigQuery works really well in cases where the data does not often change.
