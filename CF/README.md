# CLOUD FUCNTION

Cloud Functions is a lightweight, event-based, asynchronous compute solution that allows you to create small, single-purpose 
functions that respond to cloud events without the need to manage a server or a runtime environment.
These functions can be used to construct application workflows from individual business logic tasks.
