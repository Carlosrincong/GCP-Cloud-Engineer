Object storage is a computer data storage architecture that manages data as “objects”
These objects are stored in a packaged format which contains the binary form of the actual data itself, and metadata and unique id.
Object storage interacts well with web technologies
binary large-object (BLOB)
Cloud Storage files are organized into buckets (unique name and zone)
Objects are immutable and have versions with each change
