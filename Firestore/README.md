# FIRESTORE

Firestore is a flexible, horizontally scalable, NoSQL cloud database for mobile, web, and server development.
Data is stored in documents and then organized into collections
Each document contains a set of key-value pairs.
Query performance is proportional to the size of the result set
Firestore uses data synchronization to update data on any connected device.
Youâ€™re charged for each document read, write, and delete. Queries and for the amount of storage your data consumes, are also charged. Charges only begin once the free daily quota has been exceeded.
