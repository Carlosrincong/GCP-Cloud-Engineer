# FIRESTORE

Firestore is a flexible, horizontally scalable, NoSQL cloud database for mobile, web, and server development.
Data is stored in documents and then organized into collections
Each document contains a set of key-value pairs.
Query performance is proportional to the size of the result set
Firestore uses data synchronization to update data on any connected device.
Youâ€™re charged for each document read, write, and delete. Queries and for the amount of storage your data consumes, are also charged. Charges only begin once the free daily quota has been exceeded.
Firestore is best for storing, syncing, and querying data for mobile and web apps.
If you need massive scaling and predictability together with real time query results and offline query support.
Cloud Firestore also supports ACID transactions so if any of the operations in the transaction fail and cannot be retried, the whole transaction will fail.
Cloud Firestore even allows you to run sophisticated queries against your NoSQL data without any degradation in performance.
there are two modes: datasore mode and native mode (who includes new features)
